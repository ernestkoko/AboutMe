    <string name="bio">Hi, my name is Ernest.
    \n\nI love fish.
    \n\nThe kind that is alive and swims around in an aquarium or river, or a lake, and definitely the ocean.
    \nFun fact is that i have several aquariums and also a river.
    \n\nI like eating fish, too, Raw fish, Grilled fish, smoked fish, poached fish-- not so much
    \n\nAn sometimes I also go fishing.
    \nAnd even less sometimes, I actually catch sometimes.
    \n\nOnce, when i was camping in Canada, and very hungry, I even caught a large salmon with my hands.
    \n\nI\'ll be happy to teach you how to make your own aquarium.
    \nYou should ask someone else about fishing, though.\n\n</string>
